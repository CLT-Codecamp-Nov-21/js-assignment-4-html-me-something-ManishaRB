               <h2>Chocolate Chip Banana Oatmeal Muffins (Gluten Free)</h2>
               <div id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  <p>Ingredients:<br>
                  ▢2 cups gluten-free rolled oats I get mine at Trader Joes<br>
                  ▢1 cup mashed bananas<br>
                  ▢½ cup maple syrup<br>
                  ▢2 eggs<br>
                  ▢¼ cup canned coconut milk or milk of choice<br>
                  ▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
                  ▢1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
                  ▢¼ teaspoon salt<br>
                  ▢½ cup chocolate chips optional but required (heh)<br>
                  Instructions:<br>   
                  Preheat oven to 350F.<br>
                  Add all the ingredients except for the chocolate chips into a blender and blend until smooth. Fold in the chocolate chips.<br>
                  Pour batter into a lined muffin tin.<br>
                  Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.<br>
                  Allow the muffins to cool on a wire rack.<br>
                  Store the muffins in the fridge for 4-5 days.<br>

               <h2>Instant Pot Fudge</h2>
               <p>Ingredients:<br>
                  ▢1 cup sugar approx. 200 g<br>
                  ▢⅓ cup water approx. 2.8 oz<br>
                  ▢1 stick butter sliced, room temperature<br>
                  ▢2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips 12 ounces<br>
                  ▢1 cup dry milk powder 100 grams<br>
                  ▢1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
                  Instructions:<br>
                  Add the sugar and water to the instant pot and mix well.<br>
                  Secure the lid, close the pressure valve, and cook for 11 minutes at high pressure.<br>
                  Quick-release pressure.<br>
                  Add the room temperature butter slices, chocolate chips and milk powder, and vanilla extract to the pot and quickly stir until well combined.<br>
                  Pour/spoon the mixture into a parchment-lined 9×5 inch loaf pan and let it cool down (for 30-40 minutes), then put it in the fridge for 2-3 hours to set.<br>
                  Lift from the pan using parchment, then cut into squares.<br>
                  Store fudge in an air-tight container in the fridge for 2-3 weeks, or in the freezer for a few months.<br>

               <h2>Instant Pot Milk Burfi (Milk Fudge)</h2>
               <p>Ingredients:<br>
                  ▢1 cup sugar approx. 200 g<br>
                  ▢⅓ cup water approx. 2.8 oz<br>
                  ▢½ cup ghee approx. 4 oz<br>
                  ▢2 cups dry milk powder approx. 200 grams<br>
                  ▢½ teaspoon freshly ground cardamom*<br>
                  ▢1 tablespoon raw unroasted and unsalted green pistachios, chopped<br>
                  Add the sugar and water to the pot and mix well.<br>
                  Secure the lid, close the pressure valve, and cook for 11 minutes at high pressure.<br>
                  Quick-release pressure.<br>
                  Add ghee, milk powder, and cardamom to the pot and quickly mix (using either a spoon or a whisk) until well combined. You may want to wear a glove to hold onto the hot pot as you stir – you will need to be fast!<br>
                  Pour the mixture into a parchment-lined 8×8 pan/dish (you’ll need a spoon to scoop the mixture out of the pot and into the pan). Shake the pan gently so that the mixture spreads evenly. Sprinkle the chopped green pistachios on top and gently shake the pan again to help them stick.<br>
                  Let the milk burfi cool down (on a wire rack – takes about 30 to 40 minutes), then put it in the fridge for 1 hour to set.<br>
                  Remove the chilled fudge, slice it into medium-sized squares, and then place the individual pieces on a plate. If you eat the mithai at this point, it will be chewy. Let the fudge sit out at room temperature for 24 hours to dry out. This will completely change the texture of the burfi – make sure to give it time to dry out!<br>
                  After it’s dry, you can store it in an air-tight container in the fridge for about a week. I prefer to eat this mithai at room temperature.<br>

               <h2>Mango Lassi</h2>
               <p>Ingredients:<br>
                  ▢ 1 cup chopped ripe mango approx 1 to 1.25 mangoes or 185 grams<br>
                  ▢ 1 cup full-fat plain yogurt<br>
                  ▢ ½ cup water<br>
                  ▢ 3 tablespoons sugar to taste<br>
                  Instructions:<br>
                  Combine all of the ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth.<br>
                  Taste and add more sugar if necessary (mangoes vary in sweetness).<br>
                  Put the lassi in the fridge for a couple of hours until chilled or if serving immediately, pour over ice.<br>
                  Lassi can be kept refrigerated for up to 24 hours.<br>
